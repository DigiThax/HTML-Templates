# HTML Template Library

This library is a collection of HTML templates that I created for my own convenience. I wanted to have a set of reusable HTML code snippets and patterns that I could use in my projects, so I created this library to hold them.

## Features

- A variety of templates for common tasks such as layout, forms, and navigation
- Easy to use and customize for your own needs
- Well-documented and tested to ensure compatibility with different browsers

## Usage

To use the templates in this library, simply copy and paste the HTML code into your project and follow the instructions in the documentation. Each template is self-contained and can be used on its own, or you can combine multiple templates to create more complex layouts.

## Contribute

I welcome contributions from others! If you have an HTML template that you think would be useful to add to this library, please submit a pull request.
